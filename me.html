    <p id = "brand">I use code to bridge the gap between creators and consumers. I’m intuitive and logical and love making other people’s life more simplistic. </p>
    <p id = "bio">I decided to take the Web Development Immersive to give myself a firm foundation in coding. The idea of teaching students to "think like a coder" was really appealing to me. This course has taught me to enjoy collaborating with others as a team. During the course of General Assembly, we learned front end languages such as ruby, javascript, and backend such as rails, just to name a few. </p>
